 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Location/equals/equals001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     Location.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.Location.equals()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)
 *     Compares the specified Object with this Location for equality.
 *     Returns: true if the Object is a Location and if
 *              it refers to the same point in the same VM as this Location.
 *     Overrides: equals in class java.lang.Object
 *     when only one VM runs a debugged program.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.Location.equals.equals001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.Location.equals.equals001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     This test is option depended,
 *     that is its .cfg file contains the option
 *         JAVAC_OPTS=-g
 *     because at the date of preparing the test
 *     javac prepared full information for the test only
 *     been invoked with the option.
