 * DESCRIPTION
 *         This test executes one after another several JDI tests in single VM
 *         (for detailed description see nsk.share.jdi.SerialExecutionDebugger and nsk.share.jdi.SerialExecutionDebuggee).
 *         Tests to execute are specified in file 'monitorEvents002.tests', before execution test list is shuffled and tests are executed
 *         in random order, resulted test order is saved in file 'run.tests', to reproduce failed test execute it
 *         with option '-configFile run.tests'(instead of  -configFile monitorEvents002.tests).
 *         Test is treated as FAILED if at least one of executed tests failed.
